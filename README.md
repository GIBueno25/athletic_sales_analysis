# **MODULE 5 CHALLENGE**

## **Athletic Sales Analysis**
This challenge requires students to demonstrate their knowledge of coding conventions with panda. 

The challlnge starts with importng two csv files and reading them into Data Frames. It is followed by combining the two Data Frames into one using an inner join. The combined Data Frame was then updated by converting values in the "invoice_date" to a datetime data type.

Using groupby and pivot_table, I was able to analyze sales data to gain insights to determine the following:
- Which cities in the US have sold the most athletic wear over two years
- Which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear
- Which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear
- Which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear
